[Rafael Castro](https://ruevko.github.io) (a.k.a. ruevko) launched this website to test [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)
services; it also serves as a journal, of places where he traveled (and photos he captured in those places). The photos are
hereby released under [CC0 v1](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0) license.

To develop the website, [Split Gallery](https://gitlab.com/tmuguet/hugo-split-gallery) by Thomas Muguet was used; this Hugo
theme has [GPL v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) license, which allowed modifications (source code available
at [GitHub](https://github.com/ruevko/journal)). Here are some resources that were useful in the process:

* [Custom icons in Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/examples/custom-icons): how to use custom (such as Font Awesome) icons
* [Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation): some knowledge is required in order to modify a theme
* [ExifToolGUI](https://exiftool.org/gui): a Windows tool for metadata editing (useful to georeference photos)
* [Netlify large media](https://docs.netlify.com/large-media/overview): how to store the photos in a separate media server
